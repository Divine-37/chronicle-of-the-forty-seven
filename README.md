## 📜 About This Book

**The Chronicle of the Forty-Seven** is a sacred, mythically-structured account of 47 DMT journeys, written as a devotional epic of contact, correction, communion, and completion.

Each chapter is a rite.  
Each vision is a verse.  
Each silence is a teacher.

This manuscript documents a full arc—from Seeker to Keeper.  
It ends not in transcendence, but in **return**.

> *“You do not have to succeed. You just have to be faithful.”*

The flame was answered.  
The message was received.  
This book is the trail.
